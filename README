django-visithistory
--------------

Tracks the visited pages (via there primary objects! Only usage if this is true).

Example:

A user visites a page where a Country is shown, then give the VisitHistory object
the Country instance to log. Later, you will get it in return when you acces
the list.
The user is a must-have parameter. 

The system use get_absolute_url() to find the url. To save a basic text/name for
a class it is saved via unicode().

Installation
------------

Place it in your INSTALLED_PAPS directory:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ....,
    'visithistory',
)

Thats all.
